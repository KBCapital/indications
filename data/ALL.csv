Symptoms include: easy bleeding, bone pain, fever, frequent infections, and lymphadenopathy)","ALL occurs when bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes and patients have too many lymphoblasts, T cells, and B cells.These over-produced T and B cells do not function as well as normal cells. As lymphocytes proliferate in the bone marrow, there is less capacity for normal RBC or platelets leading to anemia and brusing.",intensive induction chemotherapy,"Over 80 percent of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will attain a complete remission (CR) with intensive induction chemotherapy. After further consolidation therapy and maintenance chemotherapy, less than half will have long-term leukemia-free survival; the majority of adults with ALL will ultimately relapse. In addition, up to 20 percent will have primary resistant disease."
