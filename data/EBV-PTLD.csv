Overall mortality for PTLD often exceeds 50%. In adult recipients, PTLD has been reported to occur in 1–2.3% of kidney transplants, 1–2.8% of liver transplants, 1–6.3% of heart transplants, 2.4–5.8% of heart-lung transplants, 4.2–10% of lung transplants and up to 20% of small bowel transplants.",About 85% of PTLD are of B cell lineage and >80% are associated with EBV infection. Majority of cases of PTLD arise in response to primary infection with EBV or to re-activation of previously acquired EBV,"First line is reduction of immunosuppresive regimens. Reduction in immunosuppression alone leads to long-term disease remission in 40–86% of cases of PTLD in paediatric recipients and 25–63% of adults. Polyclonal PTLD during early disease often responds well to reduced immunosuppression whereas monoclonal tumours, especially those expressing mutations such as the BCL6 mutation, are generally unresponsive to a reduction in immunosuppression. Alternatives are chemotherapy, which entails toxicity and a risk of suppression of HSCT, and rituximab which is now used as an off-label first-line. Chemo is usually ineffective in monoclonal disease."
